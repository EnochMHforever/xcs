    "\n",
    "This is the official tutorial for the [xcs package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xcs) for Python 3. You can find the latest release and get updates on the project's status at the [project home page](https://github.com/hosford42/xcs) on GitHub.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html), installation of xcs is straight forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install xcs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this goes as planned, you should see a message like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Successfully installed xcs-1.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to use pip, you can still install xcs manually. The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/hosford42/xcs/releases) or [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xcs). Download the zip file, unpack it, and cd into the directory. Then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a message indicating that the package was successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you also install numpy, though the xcs package will still work, albeit more slowly, without it. To install numpy with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instructions on how to manually install numpy, visit the [numpy installation instructions page](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) at SciPy.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing the Newly Installed Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start things off with a quick test, to verify that everything has been installed properly. First, we set up logging so we can see the test's progress."
